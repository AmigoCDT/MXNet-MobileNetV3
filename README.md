# MXNet-MobileNetV3
A Gluon implement of MobileNetV3

## How to use itï¼Ÿ
```
git clone https://www.github.com/deepinsight/insightface.git
cp $MXNet-MobileNetV3/fmobilenetv3.py $insightface/recognition/symbols
```
Then follow the insightface's parallel train usage to train face recognition, please.


## Feel free to contact me
I am just a new to MXNet and Gluon, There must be soooo many bugs in `fmobilenetv3.py`.
Feel free to contact me with issue or `CDT_look_that@outlook.com`, I will solve it as soon as I could.
